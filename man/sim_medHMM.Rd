\arguments{
\item{n_t}{Numeric vector with length 1 denoting the length of the observed
sequence to be simulated for each subject. To only simulate subject
specific transition probability matrices gamma and emission distributions
(and no data), set \code{t} to 0.}

\item{n}{Numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number of subjects for
which data is simulated.}

\item{data_distr}{String vector with length 1 denoting the observation type
of the data to be simulated. Should be set to either \code{'categorical'}
or \code{'continuous'}. Note that when simulating multivariate data, all
dependent variables are assumed to be of the same observation type. The
default equals to \code{data_distr = 'categorical'}.}

\item{m}{Numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number
of hidden states.}

\item{n_dep}{Numeric vector with length 1 denoting the
number of dependent variables}

\item{start_state}{Optional numeric vector with length 1 denoting in which
state the simulated state sequence should start. If left unspecified, the
simulated state for time point 1 is sampled from the initial state
distribution (which is derived from the transition probability matrix
gamma).}

\item{q_emiss}{Only to be specified if the data to be simulated represents
categorical data. Numeric vector with length \code{n_dep} denoting the
number of observed categories for the categorical emission distribution for
each of the dependent variables.}

\item{gamma}{A matrix with \code{m} rows and \code{m} columns containing the
average population transition probability matrix used for simulating the
data. That is, the probability to switch from hidden state \emph{i} (row
\emph{i}) to hidden state \emph{j} (column  \emph{j}).}

\item{emiss_distr}{A list with \code{n_dep} elements containing the average
population emission distribution(s) of the observations given the hidden
states for each of the dependent variables. If \code{data_distr =
  'categorical'}, each element is a matrix with \code{m} rows and
\code{q_emiss[k]} columns for each of the \code{k} in \code{n_dep} emission
distribution(s). That is, the probability of observing category \emph{q}
(column \emph{q}) in state \emph{i} (row \emph{i}). If \code{data_distr =
  'continuous'}, each element is a matrix with \code{m} rows and 2 columns;
the first column denoting the mean of state \emph{i} (row \emph{i}) and the
second column denoting the variance of state \emph{i} (row \emph{i}) of the
Normal distribution.}

\item{dwell_distr}{A matrix containing the average population parameters for
the dwelling distribution of the states. If \code{dwell_type =
  'lognormal'}, the matrix has a dimension of \code{m} rows and 2 columns;
the first column denoting the log-mean of state \emph{i} (row \emph{i})
and the second column denoting the log-variance of state \emph{i} (row
\emph{i}) of the log-Normal distribution. If \code{dwel_type = 'poisson'},
the matrix has a dimension of \code{m} rows and 1 column denoting the
group-level log-mean of the lognormal prior used to sample the subject-
specific Poisson parameters \code{lambda} of state \emph{i}
(row \emph{i}) of the poisson-lognormal distribution. Notice that in both
cases the means are expressed in the logarithmic scale (see the examples
below).}

\item{dwell_type}{Family of distribution to sample state dwelling times.
Currently it only takes de values
\code{dwell_type = c('lognormal','poisson')} which
specifies either an approximation to the discrete dwelling times through
a continuous log-Normal distribution, or a discrete Poisson distribution
with a lognormal prior. Notice that the default value is
\code{dwell_type = 'lognormal'}.}

\item{xx_vec}{List of 1 + \code{n_dep} vectors containing the covariate(s) to
predict the transition probability matrix \code{gamma} and/or (specific)
emission distribution(s) \code{emiss_distr} using the regression parameters
specified in \code{beta} (see below). The first element in the list
\code{xx_vec} is used to predict the transition matrix. Subsequent elements
in the list are used to predict the emission distribution of (each of) the
dependent variable(s). This means that the covariate used to predict
\code{gamma} and \code{emiss_distr} can either be the same covariate,
different covariates, or a covariate for certain elements and none for the
other. At this point, it is only possible to use one covariate for both
\code{gamma} and \code{emiss_distr}. The first vector of the list
\code{xx_vec} is used to predict the transition matrix. The subsequent
vectors in the list \code{xx_vec} are used to predict the emission
distribution(s) of the dependent variable(s). For all elements in the list,
the number of observations in the vectors should be  equal to the number of
subjects to be simulated \code{n}. If \code{xx_vec} is omitted completely,
\code{xx_vec} defaults to NULL, resembling no covariates at all. Specific
elements in the list can also be left empty (i.e., set to \code{NULL}) to
signify that either the transition probability matrix or (one of) the
emission distribution(s) is not predicted by covariates.}

\item{beta}{List of 1 + \code{n_dep} matrices containing the regression
parameters to predict \code{gamma} and/or \code{emiss_distr} in combination
with \code{xx_vec} using (multinomial logistic) regression. The first
matrix is used to predict the transition probability matrix \code{gamma}.
The subsequent matrices are used to predict the emission distribution(s)
\code{emiss_distr} of the dependent variable(s). For \code{gamma} and
categorical emission distributions, one regression parameter is specified
for each element in \code{gamma} and \code{emiss_distr}, with the following
exception. The first element in each row of \code{gamma} and/or
\code{emiss_distr} is used as reference category in the multinomial
logistic regression. As such, no regression parameters can be specified for
these parameters. Hence, the first element in the list \code{beta} to
predict \code{gamma} consist of a matrix with the number of rows equal to
\code{m} and the number of columns equal to \code{m} - 1. For categorical
emission distributions, the subsequent elements in the list \code{beta} to
predict \code{emiss_distr} consist of a matrix with the number of rows
equal to \code{m} and the number of columns equal to \code{q_emiss[k]} - 1
for each of the \code{k} in \code{n_dep} emission distribution(s). See
\emph{details} for more information. For continuous emission distribuitons,
the subsequent elements in the list \code{beta} consist of a matrix with
the number of rows equal to \code{m} and 1 column.

Note that if \code{beta} is specified, \code{xx_vec} has to be specified as
well. If \code{beta} is omitted completely, \code{beta} defaults to NULL,
resembling no prediction of \code{gamma} and \code{emiss_distr} using
covariates. One of the elements in the list can also be left empty
(i.e., set to \code{NULL}) to signify that either the transition
probability matrix or a specific emission distribution is not predicted by
covariates.}

\item{var_gamma}{A numeric vector with length 1 denoting the amount of
variance between subjects in the transition probability matrix. Note that
this value corresponds to the variance of the parameters of the
multinomial distribution (i.e., the intercepts of the regression equation
of the multinomial distribution used to sample the transition probability
matrix), see details below. In addition, only one variance value can be
specified for the complete transition probability matrix, hence the
variance is assumed fixed across all components. The default equals 0.1,
which corresponds to little variation between subjects. If one wants to
simulate data from exactly the same HMM for all subjects, var_gamma should
be set to 0. Note that if data for only 1 subject is simulated (i.e., n =
1), \code{var_gamma} is set to 0.}

\item{var_emiss}{A numeric vector with length \code{n_dep} denoting the
amount of variance between subjects in the emission distribution(s). For
categorical data, this value corresponds to the variance of the parameters
of the multinomial distribution (i.e., the intercepts of the regression
equation of the multinomial distribution used to sample the components of
the emission distribution), see details below.  For continuous data, this
value corresponds to the variance in the mean of the emission
distribution(s) across subjects. Note that only one variance value can be
specified each emission distribution, hence the variance is assumed fixed
across states (and, for the categorical distribution, categories within
a state) within an emission distribution. The default equals 0.1, which
corresponds to little variation between subjects given categorical
observations. If one wants to simulate data from exactly the same HMM for
all subjects, \code{var_emiss} should be set to a vector of 0's. Note that if data
for only 1 subject is simulated (i.e., n = 1), \code{var_emiss} is set to a
vector of 0's.}

\item{var_dwell}{A numeric vector with length 1 denoting the amount of
variance between subjects in the state dwelling distribution. Note that
this value corresponds to the variance of the log-mean of the lognormal
distribution in the logarithmic scale. In addition, only one variance
value can be specified for the complete transition probability matrix,
hence the variance is assumed fixed across all components. The default
equals 0.01, which corresponds to little variation between subjects. If
one wants to simulate data from exactly the same HMM for all subjects,
\code{var_dwell} should be set to 0. Note that if data for only 1 subject
is simulated (i.e., n = 1), \code{var_dwell} is set to 0.}

\item{return_ind_par}{A logical scalar. Should the subject specific
transition probability matrix \code{gamma} and emission probability matrix
\code{emiss_distr} be returned by the function (\code{return_ind_par =
  TRUE}) or not (\code{return_ind_par = FALSE}). The default equals
\code{return_ind_par = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The following components are returned by the function
\code{sim_medHMM}:
\describe{
\item{\code{states}}{A matrix containing the simulated hidden state
sequences, with one row per hidden state per subject. The first column
indicates subject id number. The second column contains the simulated
hidden state sequence, consecutively for all subjects. Hence, the id number
is repeated over the rows (with the number of repeats equal to the length
of the simulated hidden state sequence \code{T} for each subject).}
\item{\code{obs}}{A matrix containing the simulated observed outputs, with
one row per simulated observation per subject. The first column indicates
subject id number. The second column contains the simulated observation
sequence, consecutively for all subjects. Hence, the id number is repeated
over rows (with the number of repeats equal to the length of the simulated
observation sequence \code{T} for each subject).}
\item{\code{subject_gamma}}{A list containing \code{n} elements with the simulated
subject specific transition probability matrices \code{gamma}. Only
returned if \code{return_ind_par} is set to \code{TRUE}.}
\item{\code{subject_emiss}}{A list containing \code{n} elements with the
simulated subject specific emission parameter matrices
\code{emiss_distr}. Only returned if \code{return_ind_par} is set to
\code{TRUE}.}
\item{\code{subject_dwell}}{A list containing \code{n} elements with the
simulated subject specific state dwelling parameter matrices
\code{subject_dwell}. Only returned if \code{return_ind_par} is set to
\code{TRUE}.}

\description{
\code{sim_medHMM} simulates data for multiple subjects, for which the data
have either categorical or continuous (i.e., normally distributed)
observations that follow an explicit-duration hidden (semi-) Markov model
(HMM) with a multilevel structure. The multilevel structure implies that
each subject is allowed to have its own set of parameters, and that the
parameters at the subject level (level 1) are tied together by a population
distribution at level 2 for each of the corresponding parameters. The shape
of the population distribution for each of the parameters is a normal
distribution. In addition to (natural and/or unexplained) heterogeneity
between subjects, the subjects parameters can also depend on a covariate.
}
\details{
In simulating the data, having a multilevel structure means that the
parameters for each subject are sampled from the population level
distribution of the corresponding parameter. The user specifies the
population distribution for each parameter: the average population transition
probability matrix and its variance, and the average population emission
distribution and its variance. For now, the variance of the mean population
parameters is assumed fixed for all components of the transition probability
matrix and for all components of the emission distribution.

One can simulate multivariate data. That is, the hidden states depend on more
than 1 observed variable simultaneously. The distributions of multiple
dependent variables for multivariate data are assumed to be independent, and
all distributions for one data set have to be of the same type (either
categorical or continuous).

Note: the subject specific) initial state distributions (i.e., the
probability of each of the states at the first time point) needed to simulate
the data are obtained from the stationary distributions of the subject
specific transition probability matrices gamma.

\code{beta}: As the first element in each row of \code{gamma} is used as
reference category in the multinomial logistic regression, the first matrix
in the list \code{beta} used to predict transition probability matrix
\code{gamma} has a number of rows equal to \code{m} and the number of columns
equal to \code{m} - 1. The first element in the first row corresponds to the
probability of switching from state one to state two. The second element in
the first row corresponds to the probability of switching from state one to
state three, and so on. The last element in the first row corresponds to the
probability of switching from state one to the last state. The same principle
holds for the second matrix in the list \code{beta} used to predict
categorical emission distribution(s) \code{emiss_distr}: the first element in
the first row corresponds to the probability of observing category two in
state one. The second element in the first row corresponds to the probability
of observing category three is state one, and so on. The last element in the
first row corresponds to the probability of observing the last category in
state one.
